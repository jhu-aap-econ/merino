`merino` is a powerful, open-source resource designed to help you conquer the world of econometrics using Python. This repository provides a comprehensive collection of interactive **MyST Markdown** and **Jupyter** notebooks that delve into regression analysis, statistical inference, numerical optimization, and other vital econometric techniques. Whether you're a student, researcher, or a seasoned practitioner, `merino` offers a hands-on learning experience to enhance your understanding and practical skills.

A key feature of `merino` is that these notebooks can be executed **directly in your browser** without any server setup or on platforms like Google Colab.

## Why `merino`?

-   **Comprehensive Coverage:** `merino` mirrors the in-depth curriculum of "Using Python for Introductory Econometrics," covering a wide range of topics from basic regression models to advanced time series analysis.
-   **Interactive Learning:** Each notebook is meticulously crafted using **MyST Markdown** and **Jupyter**, allowing you to experiment with code, modify parameters, and visualize results directly within your browser or in Google Colab.
-   **In-Browser Execution:** You can run these notebooks **directly in your browser**—no server setup required!
-   **Practical Applications:** `merino` emphasizes the practical application of econometric principles, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world data analysis.
-   **Beginner-Friendly & Advanced-Ready:** The notebooks are structured progressively, making them accessible to beginners while still offering valuable insights for those with prior econometrics knowledge.
-   **Open Source & Community-Driven:** `merino` is open-source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the econometrics community.
-   **Multiple Execution Options:** Run the notebooks directly in your browser or on platforms like Google Colab – the choice is yours!

## Based on the Books:

These notebooks are based on the excellent companion book to Jeffrey M. Wooldridge's "Introductory Econometrics":

-   [**Using Python for Introductory Econometrics**](http://upfie.net) by Florian Heiss and Daniel Brunner

This companion book introduces the Python programming language with a focus on implementing standard econometric tools and methods. It is designed to be used alongside Wooldridge's textbook, providing a seamless transition from theory to practice.

**It is highly recommended to use `merino` in conjunction with Wooldridge's "Introductory Econometrics" and "Using Python for Introductory Econometrics" for a deeper understanding of the underlying theory and the practical implementation.**
