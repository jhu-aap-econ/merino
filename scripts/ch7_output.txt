Linear Probability Model: Labor Force Participation
Range of predicted probabilities:
Minimum: -0.3451
Maximum: 1.1272

Proportion of predictions outside [0, 1]:
33 out of 753 (4.38%)

Comparison of Standard Errors:
Sample size: 500
Treatment group: 198 (39.6%)
Control group: 302 (60.4%)

Naive Comparison (Simple Difference in Means):
Average earnings (treatment group): $45.98k
Average earnings (control group): $45.82k
Naive treatment effect: $0.16k

Regression-Adjusted Treatment Effect:

Difference-in-Differences Estimation:

Chow Test for Structural Break (Gender Differences):
SSR pooled: 93.9113
SSR unrestricted (male + female): 79.9204
Chow F-statistic: 14.9968
Degrees of freedom: (6, 514)
P-value: 0.000000
Critical value (5% level): 2.1162

Conclusion: REJECT null hypothesis - significant structural break
The wage-education relationship differs significantly by gender

F-test on Interaction Terms (Equivalent to Chow Test):
F-statistic: 14.9968
P-value: 0.000000

Note: This F-statistic should match the Chow test statistic

Test for Different Intercepts Only (Same Slopes):
Female coefficient (intercept shift): -0.296511
Standard error: 0.035805
t-statistic: -8.2812
p-value: 0.000000

Conclusion: Intercepts differ significantly by gender
(but this doesn't test whether slopes also differ)
