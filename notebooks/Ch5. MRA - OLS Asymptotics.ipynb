    "# Chapter 5: Multiple Regression Analysis - OLS Asymptotics\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptotic theory provides the foundation for statistical inference when sample sizes are large, describing the limiting behavior of OLS estimators as $n \\to \\infty$. This chapter establishes consistency and asymptotic normality of OLS estimators, develops large-sample inference procedures, and addresses practical complications including heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors and asymptotically efficient estimation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation builds from fundamental concepts to practical applications. We begin by establishing consistency and asymptotic normality under the Gauss-Markov assumptions (Section 5.1), demonstrate large-sample hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction (Section 5.2), examine asymptotic efficiency through the Gauss-Markov theorem's large-sample analog (Section 5.3), and conclude with robust inference methods when assumptions fail (Section 5.4). Throughout, we emphasize the practical relevance of asymptotic approximations for finite samples typically encountered in applied econometric research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Asymptotic Properties of OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the Gauss-Markov assumptions **MLR.1-MLR.4** (from Chapter 3: linearity, random sampling, no perfect collinearity, and zero conditional mean), OLS estimators have the following asymptotic properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Consistency:** $\\hat{\\beta}_j \\xrightarrow{p} \\beta_j$ as $n \\to \\infty$ for all $j = 0, 1, \\ldots, k$\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLS estimators converge in probability to the true parameter values as the sample size grows large. Consistency is a weaker property than unbiasedness--it only requires that the estimator approaches the true value asymptotically. Notably, consistency does **not** require normality (MLR.6) or homoscedasticity (MLR.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Asymptotic Normality:** $\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\beta}_j - \\beta_j) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\beta_j})$ as $n \\to \\infty$\n",
    "\n",
    "By the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**, the sampling distribution of $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ approaches a normal distribution as $n \\to \\infty$, even when the errors are **not** normally distributed. This requires:\n",
    "- MLR.1-MLR.4 (especially zero conditional mean)\n",
    "- Finite fourth moments of the errors: $E(u^4) < \\infty$ (mild regularity condition)\n",
    "- **No normality assumption required**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications:**\n",
    "- With large samples ($n \\geq 30$ typically), t-tests and F-tests are approximately valid even without normal errors (MLR.6)\n",
    "- Consistency means OLS remains reliable in large samples even under violations of MLR.5 (heteroskedasticity)\n",
    "- Asymptotic inference requires only MLR.1-MLR.4 plus regularity conditions, making it more robust than finite-sample inference\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use simulations to visualize these concepts and then apply the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test to a real-world example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection to Previous Chapters:**\n",
    "- Chapters 2-3 established finite-sample properties under Gauss-Markov assumptions\n",
    "- Chapter 4 showed exact inference requires normality (MLR.6) for finite samples\n",
    "- This chapter demonstrates that normality is **not necessary** for large-sample inference\n",
    "- These results justify the robustness claims made in Chapter 4 about t-tests with $n \\geq 30$"

    "## 5.1 Consistency of OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency** is a fundamental asymptotic property that describes whether an estimator converges to the true parameter value as the sample size grows infinitely large. While unbiasedness (Chapter 3) is a finite-sample property, consistency is a large-sample property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.1 Definition and Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: An estimator $\\hat{\\theta}_n$ of parameter $\\theta$ is **consistent** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\theta}_n \\xrightarrow{p} \\theta \\text{ as } n \\to \\infty$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: For any $\\epsilon > 0$, $P(|\\hat{\\theta}_n - \\theta| > \\epsilon) \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words: As the sample size increases, the probability that the estimator is far from the true value approaches zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Consistency Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Asymptotic reliability**: With large enough samples, consistent estimators give us values close to the truth\n",
    "2. **Weaker than unbiasedness**: An estimator can be biased but still consistent (bias vanishes as $n \\to \\infty$)\n",
    "3. **Minimum requirement**: Consistency is the least we should expect from an estimator\n",
    "4. **Practical relevance**: Most real-world datasets are large enough for asymptotics to apply\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Sample Mean**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider estimating the population mean $\\mu$ using the sample mean $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the **Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**:\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} \\xrightarrow{p} \\mu \\text{ as } n \\to \\infty$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample mean is consistent for the population mean under weak conditions (just need $E(x_i) = \\mu$ and finite variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.2 Consistency of OLS Estimators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem (Consistency of OLS)**: Under assumptions MLR.1-MLR.4:\n",
    "- **MLR.1**: Linear in parameters\n",
    "- **MLR.2**: Random sampling\n",
    "- **MLR.3**: No perfect collinearity\n",
    "- **MLR.4**: Zero conditional mean ($E(u|x_1, \\ldots, x_k) = 0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLS estimators are consistent:\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\beta}_j \\xrightarrow{p} \\beta_j \\text{ for } j = 0, 1, \\ldots, k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No normality required** (MLR.6): We don't need normal errors for consistency\n",
    "2. **No homoscedasticity required** (MLR.5): Heteroscedasticity doesn't affect consistency\n",
    "3. **Zero conditional mean is crucial** (MLR.4): Omitted variable bias prevents consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implication**: Even if errors are heteroskedastic or non-normal, OLS estimates converge to true values with large samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.3 When Consistency Fails: Omitted Variable Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The zero conditional mean assumption (MLR.4) is **critical** for consistency. If it fails due to omitted variables, OLS is **inconsistent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Wage Equation with Omitted Ability**\n",
    "\n",
    "True model:\n",
    "$$\\log(\\text{wage}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{educ} + \\beta_2 \\text{ability} + u$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated model (ability unobserved):\n",
    "$$\\log(\\text{wage}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{educ} + v$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v = \\beta_2 \\text{ability} + u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\text{Cov}(\\text{educ}, \\text{ability}) \\neq 0$, then:\n",
    "$$E(v | \\text{educ}) = \\beta_2 E(\\text{ability} | \\text{educ}) \\neq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This violates MLR.4, so $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is **inconsistent** even as $n \\to \\infty$!"

We compare this simulated density to the theoretical normal distribution that $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ should asymptotically follow.\n",

This is because while OLS is BLUE under these conditions, the asymptotic normality is approached as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n",

For $n=1000$, the simulated density is almost indistinguishable from the normal distribution.\n",

We will use error terms that follow a standardized Chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom.  Even when the error term is not normally distributed, under the Gauss-Markov conditions and assuming homoskedasticity and no autocorrelation, OLS is still BLUE. More importantly, even with non-normal errors, the OLS estimator is still consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under weaker conditions (CLT for sample averages). This simulation will demonstrate the asymptotic normality even with non-normal errors.\n",

In econometric theory, we often derive properties of OLS estimators *conditional* on the observed values of the regressors. However, in reality, regressors are also random variables. This simulation explores the implications of *not conditioning* on the regressors by drawing new samples of $x$ in each replication, along with new error terms. We will see if the asymptotic normality of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ still holds when both $x$ and $u$ are randomly drawn in each simulation run."

    "**Interpretation of 5.1.3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simulation, both the regressors $x$ and the error terms $u$ are randomly drawn in each replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small Sample Sizes (n=5, 10):** Similar to the previous simulations, with very small sample sizes, the simulated distribution of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ shows some deviation from the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Larger Sample Sizes (n=100, 1000):** As the sample size increases, even when we are not conditioning on the regressors, the distribution of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ still converges to a normal distribution. By $n=1000$, the convergence is quite evident.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation reinforces the asymptotic normality of the OLS estimator even when we consider the randomness of the regressors. The key conditions for asymptotic normality are related to the properties of the population and the law of large numbers and central limit theorem applying to sample averages, which hold true whether we condition on regressors or not, as long as certain regularity conditions are met (like finite variance of $x$ and $u$, and exogeneity). This is fundamental because in most econometric applications, regressors are indeed random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.6 The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test**, also called the **score test**, is an asymptotic test used to test restrictions on parameters in regression models. In econometrics, it is commonly used to test for omitted variables or other forms of model misspecification. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantage**: The LM test only requires estimation of the **restricted** model (under the null hypothesis), making it computationally attractive when the unrestricted model is complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asymptotic Equivalence**: Under standard regularity conditions, the LM test, Wald test, and Likelihood Ratio (LR) test are asymptotically equivalent - they have the same limiting distribution under $H_0$. In practice with large samples, they often give similar conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing restrictions in a linear regression model, the LM test statistic is often computationally simpler than the Wald or F tests, especially when the null hypothesis involves multiple restrictions on coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing $q$ restrictions of the form $H_0: R\\beta = r$ in a linear regression, where $R$ is a $q \\times (k+1)$ matrix and $r$ is a $q \\times 1$ vector, the LM test statistic can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{LM} = n \\cdot R^2_{\\tilde{u}} \\sim \\chi^2_q \\text{ asymptotically under } H_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "- $R^2_{\\tilde{u}}$ is the R-squared from a regression of the residuals from the restricted model ($\\tilde{u}$) on all the independent variables in the *unrestricted* model.\n",
    "- $q$ is the number of restrictions being tested (degrees of freedom).\n",
    "- $\\chi^2_q$ denotes a Chi-squared distribution with $q$ degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to perform an LM test are typically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Estimate the Restricted Model:** Estimate the regression model under the null hypothesis. Obtain the residuals from this restricted model ($\\tilde{u}$).\n",
    "2. **Auxiliary Regression:** Regress the residuals $\\tilde{u}$ from the restricted model on all the independent variables from the *unrestricted* model. Calculate the $R^2$ from this auxiliary regression ($R^2_{\\tilde{u}}$).\n",
    "3. **Calculate the LM Statistic:** Compute the LM test statistic as $LM = n \\cdot R^2_{\\tilde{u}}$.\n",
    "4. **Determine the p-value:** Compare the LM statistic to a $\\chi^2_q$ distribution, where $q$ is the number of restrictions. Calculate the p-value or compare the LM statistic to a critical value from the $\\chi^2_q$ distribution to make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 5.3: Economic Model of Crime\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `crime1` dataset from the `wooldridge` package to illustrate the LM test. The example considers an economic model of crime where the number of arrests (`narr86`) is modeled as a function of several factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unrestricted model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{narr86} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{pcnv} + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{avgsen} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{tottime} + \\beta_4 \\cdot \\text{ptime86} + \\beta_5 \\cdot \\text{qemp86} + u$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to test the null hypothesis that `avgsen` (average sentence length) and `tottime` (total time served) have no effect on `narr86`, i.e., $H_0: \\beta_2 = 0 \\text{ and } \\beta_3 = 0$.  Thus, we have $q=2$ restrictions.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Interpretation of Example 5.3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LM Test Statistic:** The calculated LM test statistic is 4.071.\n",
    "- **Critical Value:** The critical value from the $\\chi^2_2$ distribution at the 10% significance level is 4.605.\n",
    "- **P-value:** The p-value for the LM test is 0.1306.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the LM test statistic (4.071) is less than the critical value (4.605), or equivalently, the p-value (0.1306) is greater than the significance level (0.10), we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_2 = 0 \\text{ and } \\beta_3 = 0$.  This suggests that `avgsen` and `tottime` are jointly statistically insignificant in explaining `narr86`, given the other variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison with F-test:** The F-test directly tests the same hypothesis using the unrestricted model. The F-statistic is 2.034 and the p-value is 0.1310.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the LM test and the F-test are very similar in this case, leading to the same conclusion: we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  In linear regression models, under homoskedasticity, the LM test, Wald test, and F-test are asymptotically equivalent for testing linear restrictions on the coefficients. In practice, especially with reasonably large samples, these tests often provide similar conclusions. The LM test is advantageous when estimating the unrestricted model is more complex or computationally intensive, as it only requires estimating the restricted model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter explored the **asymptotic properties** of OLS estimators, demonstrating that large-sample inference is more robust and widely applicable than the finite-sample methods covered in Chapter 4. Asymptotic theory allows us to make valid inferences even when classical assumptions like normality fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Consistency**: OLS estimators converge in probability to true parameter values as $n \\to \\infty$ under minimal assumptions (MLR.1-MLR.4). Consistency requires correct specification (no omitted variable bias) but NOT normality or homoskedasticity. It's the minimum we should expect from an estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Asymptotic Normality**: By the Central Limit Theorem, $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ follows an approximate normal distribution in large samples, even when errors are NOT normally distributed. This powerful result allows us to use t-tests, confidence intervals, and F-tests with non-normal data, provided the sample is large enough (typically $n \\geq 30$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Asymptotic Efficiency**: Under the Gauss-Markov assumptions (MLR.1-MLR.5), OLS is asymptotically efficient among linear estimators. When heteroskedasticity is present (MLR.5 fails), OLS remains consistent but loses efficiency to Weighted Least Squares (WLS). However, we can still use OLS with robust standard errors for valid inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Normality Testing is Not Actionable**: Testing whether errors are normally distributed rarely leads to useful actions. If we reject normality, we should rely on asymptotic inference anyway (which doesn't require normality). If we fail to reject, it doesn't confirm normality. Focus instead on specification, outliers, and using robust inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) Test**: An asymptotic alternative to F-tests and Wald tests for testing parameter restrictions. The LM test only requires estimating the restricted model, making it computationally attractive. Under standard conditions, LM, Wald, and Likelihood Ratio tests are asymptotically equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Inference:**\n",
    "- With $n \\geq 30$, use asymptotic inference (standard normal critical values)\n",
    "- Always use heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (Chapter 8) as default\n",
    "- Don't worry about normality of errors - worry about specification\n",
    "- LM tests are useful when unrestricted models are complex\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Consistency:**\n",
    "- Correct specification is crucial - no amount of data fixes omitted variable bias\n",
    "- Consistency requires MLR.4 (zero conditional mean): $E(u|x_1, \\ldots, x_k) = 0$\n",
    "- Include all relevant variables or use instrumental variables (Chapter 15)\n",
    "- Check for functional form misspecification (Chapter 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Efficiency:**\n",
    "- OLS is efficient under homoskedasticity (MLR.5)\n",
    "- Under heteroskedasticity, consider WLS or GLS for improved efficiency\n",
    "- But OLS + robust SEs is a reasonable default strategy\n",
    "- Don't sacrifice consistency for efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulations demonstrated three key asymptotic results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normal errors (Section 5.5.1)**: Even with normal errors, small samples deviate from asymptotic theory. Convergence to normality is clear by $n = 1000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-normal errors (Section 5.5.2)**: With chi-square errors (highly skewed), OLS estimates still converge to normality by $n = 1000$, confirming the CLT's power.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random regressors (Section 5.5.3)**: Asymptotic normality holds whether we condition on regressors or treat them as random, reflecting real-world applications where $X$ is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison with Finite-Sample Theory (Chapter 4):**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | Finite Sample (Ch 4) | Asymptotic (Ch 5) |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Unbiasedness** | Requires MLR.1-MLR.4 | Not needed (only consistency) |\n",
    "| **Normality** | Requires MLR.6 for exact inference | NOT required (CLT provides asymptotic normality) |\n",
    "| **Homoskedasticity** | Needed for BLUE | Not needed for consistency; use robust SEs |\n",
    "| **Inference** | Exact with t and F distributions | Approximate with standard normal and $\\chi^2$ |\n",
    "| **Sample Size** | Any $n$ | Large $n$ (typically $n \\geq 30$) |\n",
    "| **Robustness** | Sensitive to violations | More robust to assumption violations |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Looking Forward:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chapter 6** explores functional form, scaling, and model selection - all crucial for correct specification\n",
    "- **Chapter 8** covers heteroskedasticity in detail, including robust standard errors and efficiency considerations\n",
    "- **Chapter 15** introduces instrumental variables for handling endogeneity when MLR.4 fails\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Bottom Line:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptotic theory is the workhorse of modern econometrics. It allows us to:\n",
    "- Make valid inferences with non-normal, heteroskedastic data\n",
    "- Justify the use of OLS in a wide variety of settings\n",
    "- Understand when and why OLS might fail (inconsistency from omitted variables)\n",
    "- Develop alternative estimators and tests (LM, GMM, IV)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most importantly**: Focus on getting the **specification** right (avoiding omitted variable bias, choosing correct functional form) rather than obsessing over classical assumptions like normality. With correct specification and large samples, OLS with robust standard errors is a reliable, general-purpose tool for empirical analysis."
