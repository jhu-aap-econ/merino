    "# 3. Multiple Regression Analysis: Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{important} Learning Objectives\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1** Explain the multiple regression framework, including why we extend beyond simple regression, the meaning of variables and parameters in the linear regression equation, and provide examples of applications in economics and behavioral sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2** Interpret parameters in multiple linear regression models as ceteris paribus effects, including cases with nonlinear transformations of variables, and explain how coefficients differ from simple regression interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3** Apply OLS estimation mechanics by deriving the normal equations, computing fitted values and residuals for any observation, and understanding the matrix representation of multiple regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.4** Evaluate multiple regression models by interpreting R-squared, comparing multiple regression results to simple regression, and understanding the \"partialling out\" interpretation of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.5** Analyze the five Gauss-Markov assumptions (linearity, random sampling, no perfect collinearity, zero conditional mean, and homoskedasticity) and explain their role in ensuring valid statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.6** Demonstrate understanding of unbiasedness conditions by identifying the minimum assumptions needed for unbiased OLS estimators and explain the importance of the Gauss-Markov theorem in justifying OLS as BLUE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.7** Diagnose and analyze omitted variable bias by determining when bias occurs, calculating the direction and magnitude of bias, and understanding the consequences for ceteris paribus interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.8** Derive and apply variance formulas for OLS estimators, including the variance-covariance matrix under the Gauss-Markov assumptions and formulas for standard errors of slope coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.9** Assess multicollinearity in multiple regression by calculating and interpreting variance inflation factors (VIFs), understanding why multicollinearity doesn't violate Gauss-Markov assumptions, and recognizing its impact on estimation precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.10** Integrate multiple regression concepts by conducting comprehensive empirical analysis that includes model specification, estimation, interpretation, assumption checking, and policy or economic insights from real-world applications.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple regression analysis extends simple linear regression to accommodate multiple explanatory variables, reflecting the reality that economic outcomes depend on numerous simultaneous factors rather than a single cause. This chapter develops the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation in the multiple regression framework, establishing the conditions under which OLS provides unbiased, consistent estimates with desirable statistical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation proceeds hierarchically through the essential components of multiple regression. We begin with motivation and mathematical specification of the multiple regression model (Section 3.1), derive the OLS estimators through matrix algebra and geometric intuition (Section 3.2), develop the crucial concept of ceteris paribus interpretation holding other factors constant (Section 3.3), examine the Gauss-Markov assumptions required for unbiasedness and establish OLS as BLUE under these conditions (Section 3.4-3.5), and address practical issues including multicollinearity, variance estimation, and model specification (Section 3.6-3.10). Throughout, we implement methods using Python's scientific computing libraries and demonstrate applications with real econometric datasets from labor economics, education, and wage determination."

    "## 3.1 Multiple Regression in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple regression analysis, we extend the simple regression model to incorporate more than one explanatory variable. This allows us to control for various factors that might influence the dependent variable and isolate the effect of each independent variable, holding others constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of a multiple linear regression model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 +\\beta_3 x_3 + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_k + u$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $y$ is the dependent variable (the variable we want to explain).\n",
    "* $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k$ are the independent variables (or regressors, explanatory variables) that we believe influence $y$.\n",
    "* $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, representing the expected value of $y$ when all independent variables are zero.\n",
    "* $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_k$ are the partial regression coefficients (or slope coefficients). Each $\\beta_j$ represents the change in $y$ for a one-unit increase in $x_j$, *holding all other independent variables constant*. This is the crucial **ceteris paribus** (other things equal) interpretation in multiple regression.\n",
    "* $u$ is the error term (or disturbance), representing unobserved factors that also affect $y$. As in simple regression (Chapter 2), we assume $E(u|x_1, \\ldots, x_k) = 0$, which implies $E(u) = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore several examples from the textbook to understand how multiple regression is applied in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3.1: Determinants of College GPA\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What factors influence a student's college GPA?  We might hypothesize that a student's high school GPA (`hsGPA`) and their score on a standardized test like the ACT (`ACT`) are important predictors of college performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model:** We can formulate a multiple regression model to investigate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{colGPA} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{hsGPA} + \\beta_2 \\text{ACT} + u$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* `colGPA`: College Grade Point Average (dependent variable)\n",
    "* `hsGPA`: High School Grade Point Average (independent variable)\n",
    "* `ACT`: ACT score (independent variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect $\\beta_1 > 0$ and $\\beta_2 > 0$, suggesting that higher high school GPA and ACT scores are associated with higher college GPA, holding the other factor constant."

    "In this log-level model, the coefficients have a percentage interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Model:** $\\widehat{\\log(\\text{wage})} = 0.284 + 0.092 \\times \\text{educ} + 0.004 \\times \\text{exper} + 0.022 \\times \\text{tenure}$\n",

    "**Coefficient Interpretations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **educ ($\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 0.092$):** Holding experience and tenure constant, an additional year of education is associated with approximately a 9.2% increase in hourly wage. Education appears to have a substantial return in the labor market.\n",
    "* **exper ($\\hat{\\beta}_2 = 0.004$):** Holding education and tenure constant, an additional year of general work experience is associated with approximately a 0.4% increase in hourly wage. The return to general experience is modest.\n",
    "* **tenure ($\\hat{\\beta}_3 = 0.022$):** Holding education and experience constant, an additional year with the current employer is associated with approximately a 2.2% increase in wage. Tenure has a larger impact than general experience, possibly reflecting firm-specific human capital or seniority premiums.\n",

    "**Question:** What factors influence the participation rate in 401(k) pension plans among firms? Let's consider the firm's match rate and the age of the firm's employees.\n",

    "* `age`: Average age of firm's employees (independent variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect $\\beta_1 > 0$ because a higher match rate should encourage participation. The expected sign of $\\beta_2$ is less clear. Older workforces might have had more time to enroll in 401(k)s, or they may be closer to retirement and thus more interested in pension plans. Conversely, younger firms might be more proactive in encouraging enrollment."

    "\n",
    "**Key Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Education Coefficient Difference:** The education coefficient is larger in the simple regression (0.108) than in the multiple regression (0.092). This difference of 0.016 represents potential omitted variable bias.\n",
    "* **Economic Interpretation:** The simple regression overestimates the return to education by about 1.6 percentage points because it fails to account for the fact that more educated workers also tend to have different levels of experience and tenure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Omitted Variable Bias Preview:** When we omit relevant variables like experience and tenure that are correlated with education, the education coefficient \"picks up\" some of their effects, leading to biased estimates. This demonstrates why multiple regression is crucial for isolating the true effect of individual variables.\n",

    "* $\\beta$ is a $((k+1) \\times 1)$ column vector of the unknown regression coefficients $(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_k)'$.\n",
    "* $u$ is an $(n \\times 1)$ column vector of the error terms.\n",

    "## 3.4 Ceteris Paribus Interpretation and Omitted Variable Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of multiple regression is its ability to provide **ceteris paribus** interpretations of the coefficients.  \"Ceteris paribus\" is Latin for \"other things being equal\" or \"holding other factors constant.\" In the context of multiple regression, the coefficient on a particular independent variable represents the effect of that variable on the dependent variable *while holding all other included independent variables constant*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we **omit** a relevant variable from our regression model, and this omitted variable is correlated with the included independent variables, we can encounter **omitted variable bias** (OVB). This means that the estimated coefficients on the included variables will be biased and inconsistent, and they will no longer have the desired ceteris paribus interpretation with respect to the omitted variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Omitted Variable Bias Violates MLR.4:**\n",
    "When we omit a relevant variable $x_k$, it becomes part of the error term: $u' = u + \\beta_k x_k$. If the omitted $x_k$ is correlated with any included $x_j$, then $E(u'|x_1, \\ldots, x_{k-1}) \\neq 0$, violating the zero conditional mean assumption. This makes OLS biased and inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's revisit the college GPA example to illustrate omitted variable bias. Suppose the \"true\" model is:\n",

    "$$\\text{colGPA} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{hsGPA} + \\beta_2 \\text{ACT} + u$$\n",

    "If `hsGPA` is correlated with `ACT` (which is likely - students with higher high school GPAs tend to score higher on standardized tests), then the estimated coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_1$ in the simple regression model will be biased. It will capture not only the direct effect of `ACT` on `colGPA` but also the indirect effect of `hsGPA` on `colGPA` that is correlated with `ACT`.\n",

    "### Properties Under the Gauss-Markov Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 3.1: Unbiasedness of OLS (MLR.1-MLR.4)**\n",
    "Under assumptions **MLR.1 through MLR.4** (linearity, random sampling, no perfect collinearity, and zero conditional mean), the OLS estimators are unbiased:\n",
    "$$E(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\beta_j \\text{ for } j = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that on average, across repeated random samples from the same population, the OLS estimates equal the true population parameters. Crucially, **homoscedasticity (MLR.5) is not required** for unbiasedness--only the first four assumptions are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 3.2: Variance of OLS Estimators (MLR.1-MLR.5)**\n",
    "Under assumptions **MLR.1 through MLR.5** (including homoscedasticity), the variance-covariance matrix of the OLS estimators $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{\\beta}_k)'$ conditional on the sample values of $\\mathbf{X}$ is:\n",
    "$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}|\\mathbf{X}) = \\sigma^2 (\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X})^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma^2 = \\text{Var}(u|x_1, \\ldots, x_k)$ is the constant conditional variance of the error term. The diagonal elements of this matrix are the variances of individual OLS estimators, and the off-diagonal elements are the covariances. Standard errors are the square roots of the diagonal elements. This result allows us to conduct valid statistical inference (hypothesis tests, confidence intervals) when homoscedasticity holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Gauss-Markov Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 3.3: Gauss-Markov Theorem (MLR.1-MLR.5)**\n",
    "Under the Gauss-Markov assumptions **MLR.1 through MLR.5**, the OLS estimators $\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{\\beta}_k$ are the **Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE)** of $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Best\" means that among all **linear** unbiased estimators (estimators that are linear functions of $y$), OLS has the smallest variance for each coefficient. More precisely, for any other linear unbiased estimator $\\tilde{\\beta}_j$ of $\\beta_j$, we have $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_j) \\leq \\text{Var}(\\tilde{\\beta}_j)$. This theorem provides the fundamental justification for using OLS in linear regression analysis under the classical assumptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition Behind the Gauss-Markov Theorem:**\n",
    "The OLS estimator achieves minimum variance among linear unbiased estimators because:\n",
    "1. **Orthogonality principle:** OLS residuals are orthogonal to all regressors, ensuring no systematic patterns remain\n",
    "2. **Efficient use of information:** OLS optimally weights observations based on the variation in $X$\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity crucial:** Equal error variances allow equal weighting; with heteroscedasticity, weighted least squares (WLS) would be more efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- BLUE property requires all five assumptions, including homoscedasticity (MLR.5)\n",
    "- Unbiasedness requires only MLR.1-MLR.4\n",

    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why These Assumptions Matter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MLR.1 (Linearity):** Without this, OLS is not the appropriate estimation method.\n",
    "2. **MLR.2 (Random Sampling):** Ensures our results can be generalized to the population.\n",
    "3. **MLR.3 (No Perfect Collinearity):** Ensures unique, identifiable estimates.\n",
    "4. **MLR.4 (Zero Conditional Mean):** Critical for unbiasedness - violations lead to biased estimates.\n",
    "5. **MLR.5 (Homoscedasticity):** While not needed for unbiasedness, it's required for efficiency and valid standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum Requirements for Unbiasedness:** Only MLR.1 through MLR.4 are needed for unbiasedness. MLR.5 is additionally required for the Gauss-Markov theorem to hold.\n",

    "## 3.5 Standard Errors, Multicollinearity, and VIF\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple regression, we not only estimate coefficients but also need to assess their precision. **Standard errors (SEs)** of the estimated coefficients are crucial for conducting hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals.  Larger standard errors indicate less precise estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error of a coefficient in multiple regression depends on several factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sample size (n):** Larger sample sizes generally lead to smaller standard errors (more precision).\n",
    "* **Error variance ($\\sigma^2$):** Higher error variance (more noise in the data) leads to larger standard errors.\n",
    "* **Total sample variation in the independent variable ($x_j$):** More variation in $x_j$ (holding other regressors constant) leads to smaller standard errors for $\\beta_j$.\n",
    "* **Correlation among independent variables (Multicollinearity):** Higher correlation among independent variables (multicollinearity) generally leads to larger standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multicollinearity** arises when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly linearly correlated.  While multicollinearity does not bias the OLS coefficient estimates, it increases their standard errors, making it harder to precisely estimate the individual effects of the correlated variables and potentially leading to statistically insignificant coefficients even if the variables are truly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** is a common measure of multicollinearity.  For each independent variable $x_j$, the VIF is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$VIF_j = \\frac{1}{1 - R_j^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $R_j^2$ is the R-squared from regressing $x_j$ on all *other* independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A VIF of 1 indicates no multicollinearity.\n",
    "* VIFs greater than 1 indicate increasing multicollinearity.\n",
    "* As a rule of thumb, VIFs greater than 10 are often considered to indicate high multicollinearity, although there is no strict cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the calculation of standard errors and VIF using the `gpa1` example again."

    "Examine the VIF values for `educ`, `exper`, and `tenure` in the wage equation. Relatively low VIF values (typically well below 10) would suggest that multicollinearity is not a severe problem in this model. If VIFs were high, it would indicate that some of these variables are highly correlated, potentially making it difficult to precisely estimate their individual effects on wage.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **VIF = 1:** No correlation with other independent variables (ideal)\n",
    "* **1 < VIF < 5:** Moderate correlation (generally acceptable)\n",

    "**Key Points About Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Does Not Violate Gauss-Markov Assumptions:** Multicollinearity is a data problem, not an assumption violation\n",
    "2. **Affects Efficiency, Not Bias:** OLS estimates remain unbiased, but standard errors increase\n",
    "3. **Makes Individual Effects Hard to Estimate:** High correlation makes it difficult to isolate individual variable effects\n",

    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has provided a comprehensive introduction to multiple regression analysis, moving beyond the simple regression model to examine relationships between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables simultaneously. Through practical examples and theoretical foundations, we have covered the essential concepts and techniques that form the backbone of econometric analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts Mastered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Regression Framework:** We learned why multiple regression is necessary for real-world analysis, where outcomes are typically influenced by several factors. The general multiple regression model allows us to examine ceteris paribus effects - the impact of each variable while holding others constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OLS Estimation and Interpretation:** We explored how Ordinary Least Squares extends to multiple regression, both conceptually and through matrix algebra. Each coefficient in multiple regression represents the partial effect of its corresponding variable, providing more nuanced and reliable insights than simple regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Gauss-Markov Assumptions:** We examined the five key assumptions (MLR.1-MLR.5) that ensure OLS estimators are Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE). Understanding when these assumptions hold - and when they are violated - is crucial for proper model specification and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Omitted Variable Bias:** Through examples like the wage equations, we demonstrated how excluding relevant variables can lead to biased estimates, emphasizing the importance of careful model specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Properties:** We covered the calculation and interpretation of standard errors, the role of multicollinearity, and tools like the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for assessing the precision of our estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, we applied multiple regression to diverse economic and social phenomena:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Educational outcomes (college GPA determinants)\n",
    "* Labor economics (wage determination)\n",
    "* Public policy (401k participation)\n",
    "* Criminology (factors affecting arrests)\n",
    "* Political economy (campaign spending and voting)\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate the versatility of multiple regression across different fields and research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts and techniques mastered in this chapter form the foundation for more advanced topics in econometrics. Understanding multiple regression estimation, interpretation, and assumptions prepares you for hypothesis testing, model building, and addressing more complex econometric challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to properly specify, estimate, and interpret multiple regression models is essential for empirical research in economics, business, and the social sciences. The tools and insights developed here will serve as building blocks for the more sophisticated econometric techniques explored in subsequent chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Chapter Mastery Check\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving to the next chapter, ensure you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Framework Understanding**: Articulate why multiple regression is essential, define all model components, and identify diverse applications across fields\n",
    "* **Parameter Interpretation**: Explain coefficients as ceteris paribus effects, handle nonlinear transformations, and distinguish from simple regression results\n",
    "* **Estimation Mechanics**: Apply OLS formulas, compute fitted values and residuals, and work with matrix representations\n",
    "* **Model Evaluation**: Interpret goodness of fit measures, compare models effectively, and understand coefficient relationships\n",
    "* **Assumption Analysis**: Master the five Gauss-Markov assumptions and their roles in statistical validity\n",
    "* **Theoretical Foundations**: Explain unbiasedness conditions and the significance of the Gauss-Markov theorem\n",
    "* **Bias Diagnosis**: Identify, calculate, and interpret the consequences of omitted variable bias\n",
    "* **Precision Analysis**: Derive variance formulas and compute standard errors for reliable inference\n",
    "* **Multicollinearity Assessment**: Use VIF measures to evaluate and address correlation among regressors\n",
    "* **Comprehensive Application**: Integrate all concepts to conduct complete empirical analyses with meaningful interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "These consolidated competencies represent the essential skills for econometric analysis and provide the foundation for advanced topics in subsequent chapters.\n",
