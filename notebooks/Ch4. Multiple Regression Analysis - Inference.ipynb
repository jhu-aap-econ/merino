    "\n",
    "This notebook delves into the crucial aspect of **inference** in the context of multiple regression analysis. Building upon the concepts of estimation from previous chapters, we will now focus on drawing conclusions about the population parameters based on our sample data. This involves hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals, allowing us to assess the statistical significance and practical importance of our regression results."

    "## 4.1 Assumptions for Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing hypothesis testing, we must clarify which assumptions are required for valid statistical inference in multiple regression. From Chapter 3, we have the Gauss-Markov assumptions (MLR.1-MLR.5) which guarantee that OLS estimators are BLUE. For statistical inference (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals), we consider two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1: Exact Inference in Finite Samples (Classical Linear Model)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For exact inference in small or finite samples using the t-distribution and F-distribution, we need an additional assumption beyond MLR.1-MLR.5:\n",
    "\n",
    "**MLR.6: Normality of Errors**\n",
    "The population error $u$ is conditionally normally distributed:\n",
    "$$u|x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the full **Classical Linear Model (CLM)** assumptions **MLR.1-MLR.6**, the OLS estimators have exact normal sampling distributions, and the t-statistics and F-statistics follow exact t and F distributions in finite samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2: Asymptotic Inference in Large Samples**\n",
    "\n",
    "For asymptotically valid inference in large samples, we need only the Gauss-Markov assumptions **MLR.1-MLR.5** (no normality required). By the Central Limit Theorem (Chapter 5), as $n \\to \\infty$:\n",
    "- The OLS estimators are approximately normally distributed\n",
    "- The t-statistics approximately follow the t-distribution (or standard normal for large $n$)\n",
    "- The F-statistics approximately follow the F-distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implication:** With moderate to large sample sizes (typically $n \\geq 30$ or more), the t-tests and F-tests are robust to violations of normality, making them widely applicable even when errors are not normally distributed. Throughout this chapter, we assume sufficient conditions for valid inferenceâ€”either MLR.1-MLR.6 for exact results or MLR.1-MLR.5 with large $n$ for asymptotic results.\n",

    "## 4.2 The $t$ Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The $t$ test is a fundamental tool for hypothesis testing about individual regression coefficients in multiple regression models. It allows us to formally examine whether a specific independent variable has a statistically significant effect on the dependent variable, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.1 General Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multiple regression model, we are often interested in testing hypotheses about a single population parameter, say $\\beta_j$. We might want to test if $\\beta_j$ is equal to some specific value, $a_j$.  The null hypothesis ($H_0$) typically represents a statement of no effect or a specific hypothesized value, while the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) represents what we are trying to find evidence for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of the null and alternative hypotheses for a $t$ test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0: \\beta_j = a_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_1: \\beta_j \\neq a_j \\quad \\text{or} \\quad H_1:\\beta_j > a_j \\quad \\text{or} \\quad H_1:\\beta_j < a_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   $H_0: \\beta_j = a_j$: This is the **null hypothesis**, stating that the population coefficient $\\beta_j$ is equal to a specific value $a_j$.  Often, $a_j = 0$, implying no effect of the $j^{th}$ independent variable on the dependent variable, *ceteris paribus*.\n",
    "*   $H_1: \\beta_j \\neq a_j$: This is a **two-sided alternative hypothesis**, stating that $\\beta_j$ is different from $a_j$. We reject $H_0$ if $\\beta_j$ is either significantly greater or significantly less than $a_j$.\n",
    "*   $H_1:\\beta_j > a_j$: This is a **one-sided alternative hypothesis**, stating that $\\beta_j$ is greater than $a_j$. We reject $H_0$ only if $\\beta_j$ is significantly greater than $a_j$.\n",
    "*   $H_1:\\beta_j < a_j$: This is another **one-sided alternative hypothesis**, stating that $\\beta_j$ is less than $a_j$. We reject $H_0$ only if $\\beta_j$ is significantly less than $a_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the null hypothesis, we use the **$t$ statistic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_j - a_j}{se(\\hat{\\beta}_j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   $\\hat{\\beta}_j$: This is the estimated coefficient for the $j^{th}$ independent variable from our regression.\n",
    "*   $a_j$: This is the value of $\\beta_j$ under the null hypothesis (from $H_0: \\beta_j = a_j$).\n",
    "*   $se(\\hat{\\beta}_j)$: This is the standard error of the estimated coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_j$, which measures the precision of our estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis and under the CLM assumptions, this $t$ statistic follows a $t$ distribution with $n-k-1$ degrees of freedom, where $n$ is the sample size and $k$ is the number of independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.2 Standard Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common hypothesis test is to check if a particular independent variable has no effect on the dependent variable in the population, which corresponds to testing if the coefficient is zero. In this standard case, we set $a_j = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0: \\beta_j = 0, \\qquad H_1: \\beta_j \\neq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $t$ statistic simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t_{\\hat{\\beta}_j} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_j}{se(\\hat{\\beta}_j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide whether to reject the null hypothesis, we compare the absolute value of the calculated $t$ statistic, $|t_{\\hat{\\beta}_j}|$, to a **critical value** ($c$) from the $t$ distribution, or we examine the **p-value** ($p_{\\hat{\\beta}_j}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rejection Rule using Critical Value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{reject } H_0 \\text{ if } |t_{\\hat{\\beta}_j}| > c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   $c$:  The critical value is obtained from the $t$ distribution with $n-k-1$ degrees of freedom for a chosen significance level ($\\alpha$). For a two-sided test at a significance level $\\alpha$, we typically use $c = t_{n-k-1, 1-\\alpha/2}$, which is the $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the $t_{n-k-1}$ distribution. Common significance levels are $\\alpha = 0.05$ (5%) and $\\alpha = 0.01$ (1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rejection Rule using p-value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{\\hat{\\beta}_j} = 2 \\cdot F_{t_{n-k-1}}(-|t_{\\hat{\\beta}_j}|)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{reject } H_0 \\text{ if } p_{\\hat{\\beta}_j} < \\alpha$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   $p_{\\hat{\\beta}_j}$: The p-value is the probability of observing a $t$ statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from our sample, *assuming the null hypothesis is true*. It's a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value indicates strong evidence against $H_0$.\n",
    "*   $F_{t_{n-k-1}}$: This denotes the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the $t$ distribution with $n-k-1$ degrees of freedom. The formula calculates the area in both tails of the $t$ distribution beyond $|t_{\\hat{\\beta}_j}|$, hence the factor of 2 for a two-sided test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:** We reject the null hypothesis if the absolute value of the $t$ statistic is large enough (greater than the critical value) or if the p-value is small enough (less than the significance level $\\alpha$). Both methods lead to the same conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4.3: Determinants of College GPA\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example investigating the factors influencing college GPA (`colGPA`). We hypothesize that high school GPA (`hsGPA`), ACT score (`ACT`), and number of skipped classes (`skipped`) are determinants of college GPA. The model is specified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{colGPA} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{hsGPA} + \\beta_2 \\text{ACT} + \\beta_3 \\text{skipped} + u$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform hypothesis tests on the coefficients $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, and $\\beta_3$ to see which of these variables are statistically significant predictors of college GPA. We will use the standard null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_j = 0$ for each variable."

Finally, it computes the two-sided p-value using the CDF of the $t$ distribution with the correct degrees of freedom (`results.df_resid`).

This suggests that higher high school GPA is associated with a significantly higher college GPA, holding ACT score and skipped classes constant.\n",

We fail to reject the null hypothesis that $\\beta_{ACT} = 0$ at the 5% significance level. This indicates that ACT score has a positive but weaker relationship with college GPA in this model compared to high school GPA.  More data might be needed to confidently conclude ACT score is a significant predictor, or perhaps its effect is less linear or captured by other variables.\n",

In these cases, the rejection region is only in one tail of the $t$ distribution, and the p-value calculation is adjusted accordingly (we would not multiply by 2).

The t-statistic for `educ` is 12.555 and the p-value is extremely small (< 0.001). We strongly reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_{educ} = 0$. We conclude that education has a statistically significant positive effect on wages.\n",

    "*   **`tenure` (Tenure):** Similarly, the coefficient for `tenure` is 0.0221 and statistically significant (p-value < 0.001), suggesting that longer tenure with the current employer is associated with higher wages, controlling for education and overall experience.\n",

These tools are fundamental for drawing meaningful conclusions from regression models and for rigorously testing economic and statistical hypotheses."
