    "# Chapter 10: Basic Regression Analysis with Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data present unique opportunities and challenges for regression analysis, requiring modifications to both estimation procedures and inference methods developed for cross-sectional applications. This chapter introduces fundamental concepts for analyzing sequential observations recorded over time, establishing the theoretical foundations and practical techniques needed to apply OLS methods when temporal ordering and dependence structure matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation develops time series regression systematically. We establish notation and key distinctions from cross-sectional analysis, emphasizing the importance of temporal ordering (Section 10.1). We then examine examples of static and finite distributed lag models (Section 10.2), develop assumptions appropriate for time series contexts including stationarity and weak dependence (Section 10.3), establish conditions for unbiasedness and consistency of OLS estimators (Section 10.4), and analyze properties of OLS under time series assumptions including serial correlation and its consequences (Section 10.5). Throughout, we implement methods using Python and illustrate applications with macroeconomic and financial time series datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from Cross-Sectional Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal ordering matters:** The sequence of observations is meaningful. Past values may influence current values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subscript notation:** We use subscript $t$ (time) instead of $i$ (individual) to index observations: $y_t, x_{1t}, \\ldots, x_{kt}$ for $t = 1, 2, \\ldots, T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modified assumptions:** The random sampling assumption (MLR.2/SLR.2) must be replaced because consecutive time observations are typically **not independent**. Instead, we require:\n",
    "   - **Stationarity:** Time series have stable distributions over time\n",
    "   - **Weak dependence:** Observations far apart in time are nearly independent\n",
    "   - These are discussed in detail in Chapter 11\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **New issues:** Time series data introduces specific challenges:\n",
    "   - **Serial correlation (autocorrelation):** Errors may be correlated across time\n",
    "   - **Trends:** Variables may exhibit long-term growth or decline\n",
    "   - **Seasonality:** Regular patterns within periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly)\n",
    "   - **Dynamic relationships:** Current outcomes may depend on past values (lags)\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these differences, OLS can still be applied to time series data under appropriate assumptions, and many results from cross-sectional analysis (unbiasedness, consistency, asymptotic normality) carry over with modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover static models, how to handle time series data in Python, finite distributed lag models, trends, and seasonality. We'll use Python libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation, `statsmodels` for regression modeling, and `matplotlib` for plotting. The examples primarily use datasets from the `wooldridge` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's ensure the necessary libraries are installed. The `%pip install` command installs packages directly within the Jupyter environment. The `-q` flag suppresses installation output for a cleaner notebook."

    "\n",
    "A **static time series model** is one where the dependent variable $y_t$ at time $t$ is modeled as a contemporaneous function of explanatory variables $z_{1t}, ..., z_{kt}$ from the *same* time period $t$. The relationship is assumed to be constant across time, aside from the error term $u_t$.\n",
