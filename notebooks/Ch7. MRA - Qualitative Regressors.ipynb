Qualitative regressors allow us to incorporate non-numeric factors like gender, marital status, occupation, or region into our regression models. We will use dummy variables (also called indicator variables) to represent these qualitative factors numerically, enabling us to analyze their impact on a dependent variable alongside quantitative regressors.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wage ~ female + educ + exper + tenure`: This formula specifies the regression model. We are regressing `wage` (hourly wage) on `female` (dummy variable for gender), `educ` (years of education), `exper` (years of experience), and `tenure` (years with current employer).\n",
    "- `smf.ols(...)`: This function from `statsmodels.formula.api` performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.\n",
    "- `results.fit()`: This fits the regression model to the data.\n",
    "- The printed table displays the regression coefficients (`b`), standard errors (`se`), t-statistics (`t`), and p-values (`pval`) for each regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intercept (const):** The estimated intercept is approximately 0.3223. This is the predicted wage for a male (female=0) with zero years of education, experience, and tenure. While not practically meaningful in this context (as education, experience, and tenure are rarely zero), it's a necessary part of the regression model.\n",
    "- **female:** The coefficient for `female` is -1.8097. This suggests that, holding education, experience, and tenure constant, women earn, on average, \\$1.81 less per hour than men in this dataset. The negative coefficient indicates a wage gap between women and men.\n",
    "- **educ:** The coefficient for `educ` is 0.5640. This means that, holding other factors constant, each additional year of education is associated with an increase in hourly wage of approximately \\$0.56.\n",
    "- **exper:** The coefficient for `exper` is 0.0185. For each additional year of experience, hourly wage is predicted to increase by about \\$0.0185, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "- **tenure:** The coefficient for `tenure` is 0.0643. For each additional year of tenure with the current employer, hourly wage is predicted to increase by about \\$0.0643, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P-values:** The p-values for `female`, `educ`, and `tenure` are very small (close to zero), indicating that these variables are statistically significant at conventional significance levels (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01). The p-value for `exper` is larger (0.2973), suggesting that experience is not statistically significant in this model at the 5% or 1% level, when other factors are controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple example demonstrates how dummy variables can be used to quantify the effect of qualitative factors like gender on a dependent variable like wages in a multiple regression framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 7.6: Log Hourly Wage Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the logarithm of the dependent variable, such as wage, is common in economics. When the dependent variable is in log form, the coefficients on the regressors (after multiplying by 100) can be interpreted as approximate percentage changes in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use the natural logarithm of hourly wage as the dependent variable and explore the interaction effect between marital status and gender, along with education, experience, and tenure (including quadratic terms for experience and tenure to capture potential non-linear relationships)."

    "- `np.log(wage) ~ married*female + educ + exper + I(exper**2) + tenure + I(tenure**2)`:\n",
    "  - `np.log(wage)`: The dependent variable is now the natural logarithm of `wage`.\n",
    "  - `married*female`: This includes the main effects of `married` and `female` as well as their interaction term (`married:female`). The interaction term allows us to see if the effect of being female differs depending on marital status (or vice versa).\n",
    "  - `I(exper**2)` and `I(tenure**2)`: We use `I(...)` to include squared terms of `exper` and `tenure` in the formula. This allows for a quadratic relationship between experience/tenure and log wage, capturing potential diminishing returns to experience and tenure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intercept (const):** The intercept is approximately 0.4254. This is the predicted log wage for a single (married=0), male (female=0) with zero education, experience, and tenure.\n",
    "- **married:** The coefficient for `married` is 0.1885. This suggests that married men (the reference group for the interaction) earn approximately 18.85% more than single men, holding other factors constant. (For small coefficients, the percentage change is approximately 100 times the coefficient).\n",
    "- **female:** The coefficient for `female` is -0.3531. This is the wage difference between single women (female=1, married=0) and single men (female=0, married=0). Single women earn approximately 35.31% less than single men, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "- **married:female:** The interaction term `married:female` has a coefficient of 0.1450. This is the _additional_ effect of being female when married, compared to being female and single. To find the wage difference between married women and married men, we need to combine the coefficients for `female` and `married:female`: -0.3531 + 0.1450 = -0.2081. So, married women earn approximately 20.81% less than married men, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "- **educ, exper, I(exper**2), tenure, I(tenure**2):** These coefficients represent the effects of education, experience, and tenure on log wage, controlling for gender and marital status. For example, the coefficient for `educ` (0.0789) suggests that each additional year of education is associated with approximately a 7.89% increase in hourly wage, holding other factors constant. The negative coefficient on `I(exper**2)` suggests diminishing returns to experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P-values:** Most variables, including the interaction term `married:female`, are statistically significant at conventional levels, indicating that marital status and gender, both individually and in interaction, play a significant role in explaining wage variations.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the `wage1` dataset, the `female` variable is already coded as 1 for female and 0 for male. We can explicitly create a boolean variable, although it is not strictly necessary in this case as `statsmodels` and regression formulas in general can interpret 1/0 variables as dummy variables."

In essence, `isfemale` is a boolean representation of the `female` dummy variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using a boolean variable (`isfemale`) that evaluates to `True` or `False` is functionally equivalent to using a dummy variable coded as 1 or 0 in regression analysis with `statsmodels`. `statsmodels` internally handles boolean `True` as 1 and `False` as 0 in regression formulas when they are used as regressors. Therefore, creating an explicit boolean variable like `isfemale` here doesn't change the regression outcome compared to directly using the 1/0 coded `female` variable.\n",

    "## 7.3 Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables represent groups or categories, and they can have more than two categories. Examples include occupation, industry, region, or education levels (e.g., high school, bachelor's, master's, PhD). To include categorical variables in a regression model, we typically use dummy variable encoding. If a categorical variable has _k_ categories, we include _k-1_ dummy variables in the regression to avoid perfect multicollinearity (the dummy variable trap). One category is chosen as the \"reference\" or \"baseline\" category, and the coefficients on the dummy variables represent the difference in the dependent variable between each category and the reference category, holding other regressors constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `C(gender, Treatment(\"male\"))`: Here, we explicitly specify \"male\" as the reference category for the `gender` variable using `Treatment(\"male\")` within the `C()` function. Now, the coefficient for `C(gender)[T.female]` will represent the log wage difference between females and males (with males as the baseline).\n",
    "- `C(oc, Treatment(\"technical\"))`: Similarly, we set \"technical\" as the reference category for the `oc` (occupation) variable. Coefficients for other occupation categories will now be interpreted relative to the 'technical' occupation group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference Categories (Changed):** Now, 'male' is the reference category for gender, and 'technical' is the reference category for occupation.\n",
    "- **C(gender)[T.female]:** The coefficient for `C(gender)[T.female]` now represents the log wage difference between females and males, with males being the reference group.\n",
    "- **C(oc)[T.category_name]:** For each occupation category (except 'technical'), the coefficient `C(oc)[T.category_name]` represents the log wage difference between that occupation and the 'technical' occupation, holding gender, education, and experience constant. For example, `C(oc)[T.admin]` will now represent the log wage difference between 'admin' and 'technical' occupations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `C()` and `Treatment()`, we can easily incorporate categorical variables into our regression models and control which category serves as the reference group. The interpretation of the coefficients for categorical variables is always in comparison to the chosen reference category.\n",

    "As before, `sm.stats.anova_lm(results, typ=2)` calculates the ANOVA table for this regression model. The row for `C(rc)` in the ANOVA table will provide an F-test and p-value for the joint significance of all the dummy variables representing the rank categories. This tests the null hypothesis that _law school rank (categorized as `rc`) has no effect on starting salary, once LSAT, GPA, library volumes, and cost are controlled for_. A small p-value would indicate that law school rank category is a statistically significant factor in predicting starting salaries.\n",
