    "# Chapter 7: Multiple Regression Analysis with Qualitative Regressors\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating categorical variables into regression models enables researchers to analyze the impact of non-numeric factors such as gender, marital status, occupation, or geographic region on economic outcomes. This chapter develops the theory and practice of using dummy variables (indicator variables) to represent qualitative factors numerically, allowing their inclusion alongside quantitative regressors in the OLS framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation builds systematically from basic dummy variable techniques to advanced applications. We begin with binary dummy variables and their interpretation as intercept shifts (Section 7.1), extend to categorical variables with multiple categories (Section 7.2), examine interaction terms between qualitative and quantitative variables allowing for slope differences (Section 7.3), address the linear probability model for binary dependent variables (Section 7.4-7.6), develop difference-in-differences methods for program evaluation (Section 7.7), and conclude with the Chow test for structural breaks (Section 7.8). Throughout, we implement these methods using Python's statsmodels library with real datasets from applied econometric research."

    "## 7.1 Linear Regression with Dummy Variables as Regressors\n",
    "\n",
    "Dummy variables (also called indicator variables or binary variables) take on the value 1 or 0 to indicate the presence or absence of a specific attribute or category. In regression analysis, they are used to include qualitative information in a quantitative framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reference Category (Base Category):** When including a dummy variable, one category is always omitted and serves as the **reference category** or **base category**. All coefficient interpretations are relative to this reference group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretation:** The coefficient on a dummy variable represents the difference in the expected value of the dependent variable between the category indicated by the dummy (when dummy=1) and the reference category (when dummy=0), holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dummy Variable Trap:** For a categorical variable with $g$ categories, we include only $g-1$ dummy variables in the regression. Including all $g$ dummies would cause perfect multicollinearity (violating MLR.3) because the dummies would sum to the constant term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If we have a gender variable with categories \"male\" and \"female\", we create one dummy variable:\n",
    "- `female = 1` if female, `female = 0` if male\n",
    "- **Reference category:** male (when `female = 0`)\n",
    "- **Coefficient interpretation:** $\\beta_{female}$ represents the expected difference in $y$ between females and males, holding other variables constant. If $\\beta_{female} = -1.81$ in a wage equation, this means females earn \\$1.81 less per hour than males (the reference group), on average, ceteris paribus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 7.1: Hourly Wage Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will investigate how gender affects hourly wages, controlling for education, experience, and tenure. We will use the `wage1` dataset from the `wooldridge` package. The dataset includes information on wages, education, experience, tenure, and gender (female=1 if female, 0 if male)."

    "- `wage ~ female + educ + exper + tenure`: This formula specifies the regression model. We are regressing `wage` (hourly wage) on `female` (dummy variable for gender), `educ` (years of education), `exper` (years of experience), and `tenure` (years with current employer).\n",
    "- `smf.ols(...)`: This function from `statsmodels.formula.api` performs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.\n",
    "- `results.fit()`: This fits the regression model to the data.\n",
    "- The printed table displays the regression coefficients (`b`), standard errors (`se`), t-statistics (`t`), and p-values (`pval`) for each regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intercept (const):** The estimated intercept is -1.5679 (dollars per hour). This is the predicted wage for the **reference group** (male, since `female=0`) with zero years of education, experience, and tenure. While not practically meaningful in this context (as education, experience, and tenure are rarely zero simultaneously), it's a necessary part of the regression model that establishes the baseline.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **female:** The coefficient for `female` is -1.8109 (dollars per hour). **Reference category interpretation:** Holding education, experience, and tenure constant, women (`female=1`) earn, on average, \\$1.81 less per hour than **men** (`female=0`, the reference category) in this dataset. The negative coefficient indicates a wage gap between women and men, with women being the lower-earning group relative to the male baseline.\n",
    "- **educ:** The coefficient for `educ` is 0.5715. This means that, holding other factors constant, each additional year of education is associated with an increase in hourly wage of approximately \\$0.57.\n",
    "- **exper:** The coefficient for `exper` is 0.0254. For each additional year of experience, hourly wage is predicted to increase by about \\$0.025, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "- **tenure:** The coefficient for `tenure` is 0.1410. For each additional year of tenure with the current employer, hourly wage is predicted to increase by about \\$0.14, holding other factors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P-values:** The p-values for `female`, `educ`, `exper`, and `tenure` are all small (0.0309 or less), indicating that these variables are statistically significant at conventional significance levels (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01).\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple example demonstrates how dummy variables can be used to quantify the effect of qualitative factors like gender on a dependent variable like wages in a multiple regression framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 7.6: Log Hourly Wage Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the logarithm of the dependent variable, such as wage, is common in economics. When the dependent variable is in log form, the coefficients on the regressors (after multiplying by 100) can be interpreted as approximate percentage changes in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use the natural logarithm of hourly wage as the dependent variable and explore the interaction effect between marital status and gender, along with education, experience, and tenure (including quadratic terms for experience and tenure to capture potential non-linear relationships)."

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wage1[\"isfemale\"] = wage1[\"female\"] == 1`: This line creates a new column named `isfemale` in the `wage1` DataFrame. It assigns `True` to `isfemale` if the value in the `female` column is 1 (meaning female), and `False` otherwise. In essence, `isfemale` is a boolean representation of the `female` dummy variable.\n",
    "- `reg = smf.ols(formula=\"wage ~ isfemale + educ + exper + tenure\", data=wage1)`: We then run the same regression as in Example 7.1, but now using `isfemale` instead of `female` in the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression table will be virtually identical to the one in Example 7.1. The coefficient, standard error, t-statistic, and p-value for `isfemale` will be the same as for `female` in the previous example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a boolean variable (`isfemale`) that evaluates to `True` or `False` is functionally equivalent to using a dummy variable coded as 1 or 0 in regression analysis with `statsmodels`. `statsmodels` internally handles boolean `True` as 1 and `False` as 0 in regression formulas when they are used as regressors. Therefore, creating an explicit boolean variable like `isfemale` here doesn't change the regression outcome compared to directly using the 1/0 coded `female` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.3 Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables represent groups or categories, and they can have more than two categories. Examples include occupation, industry, region, or education levels (e.g., high school, bachelor's, master's, PhD). To include categorical variables in a regression model, we typically use dummy variable encoding. If a categorical variable has _k_ categories, we include _k-1_ dummy variables in the regression to avoid perfect multicollinearity (the dummy variable trap). One category is chosen as the \"reference\" or \"baseline\" category, and the coefficients on the dummy variables represent the difference in the dependent variable between each category and the reference category, holding other regressors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will use the `cps78_85` dataset from the Wooldridge package, which contains data from the Current Population Survey for 1978 and 1985. We will investigate how gender, region (south/non-south), and union membership affect wages, controlling for education and experience."

    "  - `C(gender)`, `C(region)`, and `C(union_member)`: The `C()` function in `statsmodels` formula language tells the regression function to treat these as categorical variables. `statsmodels` will automatically create dummy variables for each category except for the reference category. By default, `statsmodels` will choose the first category in alphabetical order as the reference category. For `gender`, 'female' will be the reference; for `region`, 'non-south' will be the reference; and for `union_member`, 'non-union' will be the reference.\n",

    "- **C(gender)[T.male]:** The coefficient represents the log wage difference between males and females, holding education, experience, region, and union membership constant. If positive and significant, males earn more than females on average.\n",
    "- **C(region)[T.south]:** Represents the log wage difference between individuals in the south and non-south regions, holding other variables constant.\n",
    "- **C(union_member)[T.union]:** Represents the log wage difference between union and non-union workers, holding other variables constant. This is often called the \"union wage premium.\"\n",
    "- **educ and exper:** The coefficients represent the effect of each additional year of education or experience on log wage, holding gender, region, union membership, and the other variable constant.\n",
    "- **P-values:** Small p-values indicate that the corresponding variable is a statistically significant predictor of log wage."

    "- `C(gender, Treatment(\"male\"))`: Here, we explicitly specify \"male\" as the reference category for the `gender` variable using `Treatment(\"male\")` within the `C()` function. Now, the coefficient for `C(gender)[T.female]` will represent the log wage difference between females and males (with males as the baseline).\n",
    "- `C(region, Treatment(\"south\"))`: Similarly, we set \"south\" as the reference category for the `region` variable. The coefficient for `C(region)[T.non-south]` will now represent the log wage difference between non-south and south regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference Categories (Changed):** Now, 'male' is the reference category for gender, and 'south' is the reference category for region.\n",
    "- **C(gender)[T.female]:** The coefficient now represents the log wage difference between females and males, with males being the reference group. This will have the opposite sign compared to the `C(gender)[T.male]` coefficient from the previous regression.\n",
    "- **C(region)[T.non-south]:** The coefficient represents the log wage difference between non-south and south regions, with south being the reference group.\n",
    "- **educ and exper:** The coefficients remain unchanged regardless of which reference category is chosen for the categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By using `C()` and `Treatment()`, we can easily incorporate categorical variables into our regression models and control which category serves as the reference group. The interpretation of the coefficients for categorical variables is always in comparison to the chosen reference category.\n",

They decompose the total variance in the dependent variable into components attributable to different sets of regressors. In the context of categorical variables, ANOVA tables can be used to test the joint significance of all dummy variables representing a categorical variable."

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `table_anova = sm.stats.anova_lm(results, typ=2)`: This function from `statsmodels.stats` calculates the ANOVA table for the fitted regression model (`results`). `typ=2` specifies Type II ANOVA, which is generally recommended for regression models, especially when there might be some imbalance in the design (which is common in observational data).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation of ANOVA Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANOVA table output will typically include columns like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **df (degrees of freedom):** For each regressor (or group of regressors).\n",
    "- **sum_sq (sum of squares):** The sum of squares explained by each regressor (or group of regressors).\n",
    "- **mean_sq (mean square):** Mean square = sum_sq / df.\n",
    "- **F (F-statistic):** F-statistic for testing the null hypothesis that all coefficients associated with a particular regressor (or group of regressors) are jointly zero.\n",
    "- **PR(>F) (p-value):** The p-value associated with the F-statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example, in the ANOVA table output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gender:** The row for `gender` will give you an F-statistic and a p-value. This tests the null hypothesis that _gender has no effect on log wage, once education, experience, region, and union membership are controlled for_. A small p-value (e.g., < 0.05) would suggest that gender is a statistically significant factor in explaining wage variation, even after controlling for other variables.\n",
    "- **region:** Similarly, the row for `region` will test the significance of the region indicator. It tests the null hypothesis that _region has no effect on log wage, once education, experience, gender, and union membership are controlled for_. A small p-value would indicate that region is a significant factor.\n",
    "- **union:** The row for `union` tests whether union membership significantly affects log wages after controlling for other variables.\n",
    "- **educ and exper:** ANOVA table also provides F-tests for `educ` and `exper`, testing their significance in the model.\n",
    "- **Residual:** This row represents the unexplained variance (residuals) in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA tables provide F-tests for the joint significance of regressors, especially useful for categorical variables with multiple dummy variables. They help assess the overall contribution of each set of regressors to explaining the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.4 Breaking a Numeric Variable Into Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it might be useful to convert a continuous numeric variable into a categorical variable. This can be done for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-linear effects:** If you suspect that the effect of a numeric variable is not linear, categorizing it can capture non-linearities without explicitly modeling a complex functional form.\n",
    "- **Easier interpretation:** Categorical variables can sometimes be easier to interpret, especially when dealing with ranges or levels of a variable.\n",
    "- **Dealing with outliers or extreme values:** Grouping extreme values into categories can reduce the influence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 7.8: Effects of Law School Rankings on Starting Salaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will examine the effect of law school rankings on starting salaries of graduates. The `lawsch85` dataset from `wooldridge` contains information on law school rankings (`rank`), starting salaries (`salary`), LSAT scores (`LSAT`), GPA, library volumes (`libvol`), and cost (`cost`)."

For example, `C(rc)[T.(0,10)]` coefficient would represent the approximate percentage salary premium for graduates of law schools ranked (0, 10] compared to those from schools ranked (100, 175]. We expect these coefficients to be positive and decreasing as the rank category range increases (i.e., better ranked schools should have higher starting salaries).\n",

The row for `C(rc)` in the ANOVA table will provide an F-test and p-value for the joint significance of all the dummy variables representing the rank categories. This tests the null hypothesis that _law school rank (categorized as `rc`) has no effect on starting salary, once LSAT, GPA, library volumes, and cost are controlled for_. A small p-value would indicate that law school rank category is a statistically significant factor in predicting starting salaries.\n",

    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The full Chow test (or F-test on all interactions) tests whether **any** coefficients differ\n",
    "- The intercept-only test is more restrictive and asks only whether the baseline wage differs\n",
    "- If the full Chow test rejects but the intercept-only test doesn't, this suggests slopes differ even if intercepts don't\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chow test is essentially the same as testing the joint significance of all interaction terms in a fully interacted model. The interaction approach is more flexible because you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test for different intercepts only (one dummy)\n",
    "2. Test for different slopes only (slope interactions)\n",
    "3. Test for any differences (all interactions including intercept)\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a comprehensive framework for testing structural stability across groups or time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 7 introduced qualitative (categorical) regressors into the multiple regression framework, expanding our ability to model economic relationships and evaluate policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dummy Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary variables taking values 0 or 1 to represent categories\n",
    "- Interpretation: $\\beta_{\\text{dummy}}$ is the average difference between groups, holding other variables constant\n",
    "- In log models: Percentage difference $\\approx 100 \\times \\beta_{\\text{dummy}}$ (exact: $100 \\times [\\exp(\\beta) - 1]$)\n",
    "- Always exclude one category (reference group) to avoid perfect multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Categories:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use $J-1$ dummies for $J$ categories\n",
    "- Coefficients measure differences relative to the omitted reference group\n",
    "- F-tests can test overall significance of categorical variables\n",
    "- ANOVA tables decompose variation within and between groups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dummy-continuous:** Allow slope of continuous variable to differ across groups\n",
    "  - $y = \\beta_0 + \\delta_0 D + \\beta_1 x + \\delta_1 (D \\times x)$\n",
    "  - For group $D=0$: slope is $\\beta_1$\n",
    "  - For group $D=1$: slope is $\\beta_1 + \\delta_1$\n",
    "- **Dummy-dummy:** Allow effect of one dummy to vary across another dummy\n",
    "  - Interaction coefficient is the additional effect when both dummies are 1\n",
    "- **Full interactions:** Allow complete regression functions (intercepts and all slopes) to differ across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Probability Model (LPM):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- OLS regression with binary (0/1) dependent variable\n",
    "- Fitted values are estimated probabilities: $\\hat{P}(y=1|\\mathbf{x})$\n",
    "- Coefficients represent marginal effects on probabilities (in percentage points)\n",
    "- Limitations: Predictions outside $[0,1]$, heteroskedastic errors, constant marginal effects\n",
    "- Always use robust standard errors with LPM\n",
    "- Alternative models: Probit and logit (Chapter 17)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression adjustment:** Control for observable differences using covariates\n",
    "  - Treatment effect $\\delta$ from: $y = \\beta_0 + \\delta D_{\\text{treat}} + \\mathbf{x}'\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + u$\n",
    "- **Difference-in-differences:** Control for time-invariant unobservables\n",
    "  - DD estimator from: $y = \\beta_0 + \\delta_0 (D \\times \\text{After}) + \\beta_1 D + \\beta_2 \\text{After} + u$\n",
    "  - Requires parallel trends assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chow Test:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formal test for structural breaks (parameter stability across groups/time)\n",
    "- Tests $H_0$: All coefficients equal across groups\n",
    "- Implementation: Compare pooled vs separate regressions, or F-test on interactions\n",
    "- Flexible: Can test different intercepts only, different slopes only, or all differences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating dummy variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatic with categorical in formula: `y ~ C(region) + x1 + x2`\n",
    "- Manual creation: `data[\"female\"] = (data[\"sex\"] == \"F\").astype(int)`\n",
    "- Multiple categories: `pd.get_dummies(data[\"occupation\"], drop_first=True, prefix=\"occ\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactions in formulas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dummy-continuous: `y ~ female * educ` expands to `female + educ + female:educ`\n",
    "- Full interaction: `y ~ female * (educ + exper + tenure)` includes all interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing with F-tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Joint significance: `results.f_test(\"C(region)[T.midwest] = 0, C(region)[T.south] = 0\")`\n",
    "- Chow test: `results.f_test(\"female = 0, female:educ = 0, female:exper = 0\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robust standard errors:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For LPM and heteroskedasticity: `model.fit(cov_type=\"HC3\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dummy variable trap:** Including all categories plus intercept causes perfect multicollinearity. Always exclude one reference group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Misinterpreting log models:** In $\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\delta D + \\cdots$, the coefficient $\\delta$ is NOT the percentage difference. Use $100 \\times [\\exp(\\delta) - 1]$ for exact percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ignoring heteroskedasticity in LPM:** LPM has heteroskedastic errors by construction. Always use robust standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Extrapolating LPM:** Predictions outside $[0,1]$ are nonsensical. LPM works best when most fitted values are in $(0.2, 0.8)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Confusing treatment assignment with treatment effect:** Selection bias occurs when treatment group differs from control group in unobservables. Regression adjustment only controls for observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Forgetting interaction interpretation:** When $x_1$ and $x_2$ interact, the marginal effect of $x_1$ depends on the value of $x_2$ (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "**To previous chapters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chapter 3:** Dummy variables extend multiple regression to qualitative data\n",
    "- **Chapter 4:** Same inference tools (t-tests, F-tests) apply to dummy coefficients\n",
    "- **Chapter 6:** Interaction terms as generalization of functional form flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**To later chapters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chapter 8:** Heteroskedasticity-robust inference critical for LPM\n",
    "- **Chapter 13-14:** Panel data methods extend difference-in-differences\n",
    "- **Chapter 15:** Instrumental variables for endogenous treatment assignment\n",
    "- **Chapter 17:** Probit and logit models for binary outcomes (nonlinear alternatives to LPM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use dummy variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modeling discrete categories (gender, region, industry)\n",
    "- Capturing seasonal or time effects\n",
    "- Policy evaluation (treatment/control comparisons)\n",
    "- Testing parameter stability (Chow test framework)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing reference group:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick largest or most natural comparison group\n",
    "- Be explicit about omitted category in interpretation\n",
    "- Results are invariant to choice (same F-tests), but interpretation changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interaction modeling strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start simple: Test dummy main effect only\n",
    "2. If theoretically motivated, add interactions\n",
    "3. Test joint significance of interactions (F-test)\n",
    "4. If interactions significant, interpret using predicted values or marginal effects at different values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Program evaluation best practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check balance of covariates across treatment/control groups\n",
    "- Use robust standard errors\n",
    "- If treatment not random, consider IV methods (Chapter 15) or panel methods (Chapters 13-14)\n",
    "- Report both naive (unadjusted) and regression-adjusted estimates for transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reporting results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearly state reference group for categorical variables\n",
    "- For interactions, show predicted effects at meaningful values of moderating variables\n",
    "- Use visualization (predicted values plots) to clarify interaction effects\n",
    "- For LPM, always note predictions outside $[0,1]$ and use robust SEs\n",
    "\n",
