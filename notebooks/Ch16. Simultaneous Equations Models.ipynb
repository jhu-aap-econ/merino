    "Welcome to Chapter 16, where we study **simultaneous equations models (SEMs)**—systems where multiple variables are determined jointly. Unlike previous chapters where we had one equation with clearly defined dependent and independent variables, SEMs recognize that economic variables are often **mutually determined**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic examples include:\n",
    "- **Supply and Demand**: Price and quantity are simultaneously determined\n",
    "- **Labor Supply and Wages**: Hours worked and wage rates are jointly determined\n",
    "- **Macro Models**: GDP, consumption, and investment are interdependent\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge: When variables are simultaneously determined, **OLS is biased and inconsistent** because explanatory variables are correlated with the error term. We need **instrumental variables** and **system estimation methods** like **2SLS** and **3SLS** (three-stage least squares)."

    "## 16.1 The Nature of Simultaneous Equations Models\n",
    "\n",
    "A **simultaneous equations model** consists of multiple equations where some variables appear as dependent variables in one equation and as explanatory variables in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General SEM Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a two-equation system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_1 = \\beta_{10} + \\beta_{12} y_2 + \\beta_{11} z_1 + u_1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_2 = \\beta_{20} + \\beta_{21} y_1 + \\beta_{22} z_2 + u_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y_1, y_2$ = **endogenous variables** (determined within the system)\n",
    "- $z_1, z_2$ = **exogenous variables** (determined outside the system)\n",
    "- $u_1, u_2$ = **structural errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "1. $y_2$ appears on the RHS of equation 1\n",
    "2. $y_1$ appears on the RHS of equation 2\n",
    "3. This creates **simultaneity** (mutual dependence)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural vs. Reduced Form\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structural equations** are the behavioral equations of interest:\n",
    "- Represent economic theory (e.g., supply and demand functions)\n",
    "- Parameters have direct economic interpretation\n",
    "- Cannot be estimated by OLS if endogenous variables appear on RHS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduced form equations** express each endogenous variable as a function of ALL exogenous variables only:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_1 = \\pi_{10} + \\pi_{11} z_1 + \\pi_{12} z_2 + v_1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_2 = \\pi_{20} + \\pi_{21} z_1 + \\pi_{22} z_2 + v_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be estimated by OLS (all RHS variables are exogenous)\n",
    "- Don't have direct economic interpretation\n",
    "- Used to construct instruments for structural estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic Example: Supply and Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structural equations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Quantity}_D = \\alpha_0 - \\alpha_1 \\text{Price} + \\alpha_2 \\text{Income} + u_D \\quad \\text{(Demand)} $$\n",

    "**Equilibrium condition**: $\\text{Quantity}_D = \\text{Quantity}_S = Q^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "We observe equilibrium $(Q^*, P^*)$ pairs, but cannot run OLS on either equation because Price is endogenous (determined by the intersection of supply and demand).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Use instrumental variables\n",
    "- For demand: Use supply shifters (Weather) as instruments for Price\n",
    "- For supply: Use demand shifters (Income) as instruments for Price\n",

    "## 16.2 Simultaneity Bias in OLS\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply OLS to a structural equation in a simultaneous system, we get **biased and inconsistent** estimates. The bias doesn't disappear even with large samples!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why OLS Fails\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ Q = \\alpha_0 - \\alpha_1 P + \\alpha_2 I + u $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q$ = quantity, $P$ = price, $I$ = income.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: $P$ is determined simultaneously with $Q$ through market equilibrium, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E(u | P) \\neq 0 \\implies \\text{Cov}(P, u) \\neq 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This violates the fundamental OLS assumption, leading to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{plim} \\, \\hat{\\alpha}_1^{OLS} \\neq \\alpha_1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLS estimator is **inconsistent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direction of Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The direction of simultaneity bias depends on:\n",
    "1. Signs of structural parameters\n",
    "2. Relative variances of supply and demand shocks\n",
    "3. Whether supply or demand is steeper\n",
    "\n",
    "**General result**: OLS estimates are a **mix** of supply and demand parameters, not pure demand or supply parameters.\n",

    "## 16.3 Identifying and Estimating a Structural Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can estimate a structural equation, we must determine if it is **identified**. Identification asks: \"Can we uniquely recover the structural parameters from the reduced form?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identification Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three possible states**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Underidentified**: Cannot recover structural parameters (not enough instruments)\n",
    "2. **Just identified**: Can uniquely recover parameters (exactly identified)\n",
    "3. **Overidentified**: More than enough instruments (can test overidentifying restrictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order Condition for Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "For equation $i$ in a system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{# excluded exogenous variables} \\geq \\text{# included endogenous variables} - 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **necessary but not sufficient** condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb**: Each endogenous variable on the RHS needs at least one **excluded exogenous variable** (an exogenous variable that appears in other equations but not in this one) to serve as an instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rank Condition (Necessary and Sufficient)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank condition is more technical but guarantees identification. For equation $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank of the matrix of coefficients on variables **excluded from equation $i$** must equal the number of endogenous variables in the system minus 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice**: \n",
    "- Use order condition as a quick check\n",
    "- Order satisfied + economic theory → likely identified\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduced **simultaneous equations models** for analyzing systems where multiple variables are jointly determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simultaneity**:\n",
    "   - Variables are mutually determined (endogenous)\n",
    "   - OLS is biased and inconsistent\n",
    "   - Need instrumental variables for identification\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structural vs. Reduced Form**:\n",
    "   - Structural: Economic relationships of interest\n",
    "   - Reduced form: Endogenous variables as functions of exogenous only\n",
    "   - Reduced form used to construct instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identification**:\n",
    "   - Order condition: # excluded exogenous ≥ # included endogenous - 1\n",
    "   - Rank condition: More rigorous but checked by software\n",
    "   - Need at least one excluded exogenous variable per endogenous RHS variable\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Estimation Methods**:\n",
    "   - **2SLS**: Equation-by-equation, robust to misspecification\n",
    "   - **3SLS**: System estimation, more efficient but less robust\n",
    "   - Choice depends on confidence in full system specification\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extensions**:\n",
    "   - **Time series**: Macro models, IS-LM, lagged variables as instruments\n",
    "   - **Panel data**: Fixed effects + IV, more instruments, GMM methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use SEMs\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Use SEMs when:\n",
    "- Variables are clearly simultaneously determined\n",
    "- Have valid instruments (excluded exogenous variables)\n",
    "- Economic theory suggests mutual causation\n",
    "\n",
    "✗ Don't use SEMs when:\n",
    "- One-way causality is plausible (use single-equation IV)\n",
    "- No valid instruments available\n",
    "- Can't justify exclusion restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with 2SLS**: More robust, easier to diagnose\n",
    "2. **Try 3SLS**: If errors appear correlated across equations\n",
    "3. **Test identification**: Check order and rank conditions\n",
    "4. **Test instruments**: First-stage F-stats, overidentification tests\n",
    "5. **Robust SEs**: Always use heteroskedasticity-robust or clustered SEs\n",
    "6. **Compare methods**: Report both 2SLS and 3SLS for robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: Simultaneous equations models require **strong assumptions** about identification. Carefully justify exclusion restrictions with economic theory!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**: Chapter 17 covers **limited dependent variable models** where the outcome is discrete, censored, or truncated."
